<h1>Agents environment</h1>
<div align="justify">
Agents interact with their environment in addition to other agents. The environment in jtap is a network. Agents move in the network from one node to an other using links.
In order to exploit the maximum potential (efficiency and reusability) of the network, a graph database is used to create, store, and query the network. We decided to use neo4j to fulfil these tasks. It is therefore necessary to install and connect neo4j to the library.
